Getting Glass ready for development
===================================
1. Make sure you install [XE12](https://developers.google.com/glass/release-notes) on your Google Glass (released 17th December 2013)
2. On Glass go to **Settings > Device Info > Turn on debug** to enable `adb`, which allows your development system to communicate with Glass.
3. Connect Glass to your development system.
4. Deploy your own Glassware!

Your Xamarin.Android Project Settings
=====================================

Inside your project settings go to **Build > General > Target framework** and make sure it is set to **Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich)**

Inside  **Build > Android Application > Minimum/Target Android Version** must be set to **Automatic - use target framework version**

There is only one Glass version, so minimum and target SDK are the same.
